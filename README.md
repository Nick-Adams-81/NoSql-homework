# work and challenges
my work in this app consisted of setting up the mongodb and mongoose schema,
and setting up the api routes, the challenge was to get the api routes to 
work with the existing front end api calls, as soon as i figured all that out it 
was pretty easy. As for the mongodb and mongoose shema, im still a bit challenged
with mongodb, im not sure exactly how to use it, mongoose schemas im very comfortable
with as they closely resemble sequelize, which ive used before.
